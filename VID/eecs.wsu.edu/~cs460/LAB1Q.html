                CS460 LAB#1 QUESTIONS

1. Druing booting, what does BIOS do?_______________________________
   How many sectors does BIOS load from the boot device?____________
   Where in memory does BIOS load the booter?________________________


2. The booter's bs.s file begins with
   ------------------------------------------------------------
        mov  ax,#0x9800    ! set ES to 0x9800
        mov  es,ax
        xor  bx,bx          ! clear BX = 0

        xor  dx,dx          ! DH=head=0,   DL=drive=0
        xor  cx,cx          ! CL=cylinder, CL=sector
        incb cl             ! BIOS counts sector from 1
        mov  ax, #0x0202    ! AH=READ      AL=2 sectors
        int  0x13           ! call BIOS INT-13
(a). What does this piece code do?_____________________________________

        jmpi start,0x9800   ! CS=0x9800, IP=start

(b). After executing the above jmpi instruction, where is CPU executing?
     _________________________________________________________________


3. The booter's bs.s code continues with

start:                    
        mov  ax,cs          ! Set segment registers for CPU
        mov  ds,ax          ! we know ES,CS=0x9000. Let DS=CS  
        mov  ss,ax         
        mov  es,ax
        mov  sp,#8192       ! SP = 8192 above SS=0x9000

(a). What does this piece of code do?________________________________________

(b). WHY DO WE HAVE TO SET the CPU's CS, DS, SS to 0x9800?___________________

(c). sp=#8192: What's the PHYSICAL address of the stack pointer?_____________


4. In your booter, you MUST write a prints(char *s) function to print a
   string. WHY can't you use printf() of the C library?____________________


5. What's the algorithm that converts a disk block number, blk, to CHS format?
   ____________________________________________________________________________

6. The assembly function readfd(int cyl, head,sector, char *buf) is
---------------------------------------------------------------------
_readfd:                             
       push  bp
       mov   bp,sp            ! bp = stack frame pointer
HERE:
       movb  dl, #0x00        ! drive 0=FD0
       movb  dh, 6[bp]        ! head
       movb  cl, 8[bp]        ! sector
       incb  cl
       movb  ch, 4[bp]        ! cyl
       mov   bx, 10[bp]       ! BX=buf ==> memory addr=(ES,BX)
       mov   ax, #0x0202      ! READ 2 sectors to (EX, BX)

       int  0x13              ! call BIOS to read the block 
       jb   _error            ! to error if CarryBit is on [read failed]

       pop  bp                
       ret
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is called as  readfd(cyl, head, sector, buf) from C code.

(a). Draw a diagram to show the stack contents at the label HERE:
     ________________________________________________________________

(b). HOW DOES readfd() ACCESS the parameters cyl, head, sector, buf?

(c). What is the PHYSICAL address used by BIOS to read the disk block?
     ________________________________________________________________


7. In the booter, how did it find the root INODE?
 
8. From the root INODE, how did it find the INODE of /boot?


9. Assume: you have found the INODE of /boot/mtx. The INODE has
   
   12 DIRECT blocks:       i_block[0] to i_block[11] 
   MANY INDIRECT blocks:

(a). How does it load the blocks to the segment 0x1000?
