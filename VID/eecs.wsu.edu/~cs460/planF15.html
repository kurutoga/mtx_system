1. Introduction to Operating Systems:
    Unix/Linux, MTX. computer system and operations, system development 
    software, PC emulators, link C and assembly programs.

2. Booting: Develop booters for Linux and MTX.
     
3. Processes:
    Concept and implementation of processes; process states,
    context switching, process scheduling.  

4. Process management in Unix: 
      fork, wait, exit, exec, signals, pipes. 
   Processes in Minix:
      Tasks, servers and user processes in Minix; 

5. Process Synchronization:  
    The process model; mutual exclusion and critical regions, 
    Implementation of low-level mutual exclusion primitives.
    Synchronization primitives; events, event queues, semaphores.

6. Process Communication:    
    High-level process synchronization constructs; messages.

7. Process Control:      
    Scheduling algorithms. Dead lock and starvation problems.

8. Memory Management:
    Memory management schemes  
    Virtual memory and demand-paging

9. I/O drivers:         
    Serial and parallel ports, interrupt handlers.
    Interraction between interrupt handler and process.
    Design and implementation of I/O drivers;
    I/O routines approach, I/O task approach.

1. All Assignments are INDEPENDENT WORK !!  Absosulely no COPYING!!

2. Oral Quizz will be given during demo of your work.



                   SYSTEM SOFTWARE:

1. Website: http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples Directory:
            Sample Lab Assignments Solutions

2. Computers:
   Your laptops running Linux or equivalent.

===================== DO THESE in week 1 ===============================
3. Development Software:
   www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples/ contains 
 
       Dev86bin.tar.gz : 16-bit BCC development package

   Download to your Linux / directory.

   Run      zcat FILENAME.tar.gz | tar xvf -     
  
   to install BCC. Read man pages of bcc, as86 and ld86 to see how to use them.
   

4. ============= DEMO OS MTX of KCW ===============================
   MTX is a Unix-like OS designed and written entirely by KCW. 
   It can run on either REAL PCs or Virtual Machines. Get MTX at

       http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples/MTXinstallCD.iso
   
(1). Burn MTXinstallCD.iso to a CD/DVD or use it as a virtual CD.

(2). Install QEMU on your Linux machine:

(2).1: Ubuntu Users: apt-get install qemu-system-i386
       The command to run QEMU is    qemu-system-i386 -OPTIONs

(2).2. Other Linux:
      ------------------------------------------
      mount -o loop MTXinstallCD.iso /mnt
      cp /mnt/vdisk ./
      cp /mnt/qemu-0.9.1-i386.tar.gz /
      umount /mnt
      cd /
      zcat qemu-0.9.1-i386.tar.gz | tar xvf -
      ------------------------------------------

(3). Run QEMU on vdisk:

         qemu -hda vdisk -smp 8 -m 512m -serial mon:stdio

     Then boot up MTX from partitions 

          1 (rmtx): MTX in 16-bit real mode
          2 (pmtx): MTX in 32-bit protected mode
          3 (smp) : SMP MTX in 32-bit protected mode
          4 (mtx32.1): MTX in 32-bit mode using segmentation

(4). When MTX starts, login as root
          login: root
          password: 12345

(5). Enter commands for sh to execute, just like in Unix/Linux
