<Pre>

READING: Chapter 6.14: Pipes

1. File Descriptors:

     #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

     int fd = open("file", flag); /* O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, ... */

     On success, open() returns a fd >= 0, called a file descriptor, which is
     an index in the fd[NFD] array in the proc structure.
     Each fd[i] is a pointer to an OpenFileTable (OFT) entry, which points to 
     the file's (in-memory) inode. Refer to CS360 notes for file descriptors, 
     OFT and inodes.

2. Pipes:
         int pd[2];
         int r = pipe(pd);  

     creates 2 file descriptors. pd[0] is for READ the pipe, pd[1] is for WRITE
     the pipe. After crating a pipe, it appears that the process can do both
     READ and WRITE operations on the pipe. However, this is NOT so! As will be
     shown later, pipes are NOT for one process to use. For each pipe, a process
     MUST be either a READER or a WRITER, but NOT both. A READER process must 
     close its write descriptor pd[1]. A WRITER process must close its read 
     descriptor pd[0]. To find out why, try to run the following program under
     Linux:

     main()
     {
        int pd[2]; char buf[8192]; 
        pipe(pd);
        read(pd[0], buf, 1);     // OR   write(pd[1], buf, 8192); 
     }

     What would happen are these. The read() syscall would cause the process 
     to hang (sleep in Kernel, waiting for data from a WRITER, but who is the 
     WRITER?). In Linux, the pipe size is 4KB. When a process tries to write 
     more than the pipe size, the pipe becomes FULL, which causes the process
     to wait for rooms in the pipe, which can only be created by some process 
     reading the pipe, but who is the READER here?). In either case, the 
     process locks itself out since it would wait for itself!. So, what's the 
     correct way of using a pipe? 

3. File Sharing:
     When a process forks, the child process inherits all the file descriptors
     of the parent. Thus, pipe descriptors are also passed on to children and
     descendant processes, allowing them to share the pipe..

4. Processes sharing pipes:
     A pipe may be regarded as a FIFO device with 
            psize = pipe size (in bytes);
            room  = empty space in pipe (initial = psize);
            data  = number of bytes in pipe (initial = 0)
     and 2 sets of processes; READERS and WRITERS, which behave as follows:

(A). WRITER Processes: They call

            n = write(pd[1], buf, nbytes);

     which tries to write nbytes of data to the pipe, subject to these 
     constraints.
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
     (1). If (no READER on the pipe) ===> return BROKEN_PIPE_ERROR;
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
                    (pipe still have READERs):
     (2). If (pipe has room)  ===> write as much as it can until all nbytes are
                                   written or (3).
                                   "wakeup" READERs that are waiting for data.  

     (3)  If (no room in pipe)===>"wakeup" READERs that are waiting for data
                                  "wait" for room; 
                                   Then try to write again from (1).
          ------------------------------------------------------------------

(B). READER Processes: They call  
      
             n = read(pd[0], buf, nbytes);

      which tries to read nbytes from the pipe, subject to these constraints:
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      (1). If (no WRITER on the pipe)
               read as much as it can; either nbytes or until no more data.
                                       return ACTUAL number of bytes read.
           --------------------------------------------------------------
                      (pipe still have WRITERs)
      (2). if (pipe has data)    ==> read until nbytes or (3).
                                     "wakeup" WRITERs that are waiting for room

      (3). if (NO data in pipe)  ==> "wakeup" WRITERs that are waiting for room
                                     "wait" for data; 
                                     then try to read again from (1).
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------

(C). Synchronization between READERS and WRITERS:

       As shown, WRITERS may "wait" because there are no room in the pipe. 
       If so, READERS must "wakeup" such WRITERS after reading (which creates
       rooms). Similarly, READERS may "wait" because of no data in the pipe. 
       If so, WRITERs must "wakeup" any such READERS after writing.

       NOTE that I have quoted the terms "wait" and "wakeup", where 

       "wait" means the process indicates the waiting condition and suspends
       itself until the awaited condition becomes true, and
       "wakeup" means a process makes one or more processes READY to run again
       when their awaited condition is satisfied. 

(D). Synchronization Tools:

     The above "wait"/"wakeup" operations are known as synchronization tools
     because they allow processes to synchronize their operations.

     One example of "wait"/"wakeup" is the sleep()/wakeup() operations of our
     MTX kernel, which are similar to those of the Unix kernel.
     In fact, sleep()/wakeup() are the most suitable synchronization mechanism
     for pipes, due to their special semantics:

     (1). Pipes only guarantee FIFO of data (into and out-of of the pipe), but
          does NOT enforce any sepcific order of the processes reading/writing
          the pipe.
     (2). Processes may read/write pipes in different units; e.g. writers may 
          write "lines" to the pipe while readers may read "chars". 
          For example, in a typical pipe usage

                       cmd_1 | cmd_2  

          it is unreasonable to expect that cmd_2 MUST read input data in the 
          same units generated by cmd_1.

     In addition to sleep()/wakeup(), there are other synchronization tools, 
     such as SEMAPHORES. Semaphores will be covered in details later.

     =====================================================================
     typedef struct oft{
             int mode;        /* READ, WRITE, READ_PIPE, WRITE_PIPE, etc */  
             int refCount;

     PIPE pipe[NPIPE];
     OFT  oft[NOFT];

     PROC proc[NTASK],*running;
     PROC *freeList, *readyQueue, *sleepList;
     ===================================================================

3-3. Functions:
     kpipe()   ===> create a pipe, return 2 file descriptors, e.g.
                    even for READ, odd for WRITE.
     ----------------------------------------------


(A). WRITER Proces: call 

            n = write(pd[1], buf, nbytes);

     which tries to write nbytes of data to the pipe, subject to these 
     constraints.
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
     (1). If (no READER on the pipe) return BROKEN_PIPE_ERROR;
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
                     (pipe still have READERs):
     (2). If (pipe has room){
              write as much as it can until all nbytes are written or (3).
              "wakeup" READERs that are waiting for data.  
          }
     (3)  If (no room in pipe){
             "wakeup" READERs that are waiting for data
             "wait" for room; 
              then try to write again from (1).
          }
          ------------------------------------------------------------------

(B). READER Process: call  
      
             n = read(pd[0], buf, nbytes);

      which tries to read nbytes from the pipe, subject to these constraints:
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      (1). If (no WRITER on the pipe){
              read as much as it can; either nbytes or until no more data.
              return n=ACTUAL number of bytes read ( n MAY BE 0 !!!)
           }.
           --------------------------------------------------------------
                      (pipe still have WRITERs)
      (2). if (pipe has data){
              read until nbytes or (3).
              "wakeup" WRITERs that are waiting for room
           }
      (3). if (NO data in pipe){
              "wakeup" WRITERs that are waiting for room
              "wait" for data; 
              then try to read again from (1).
           }

     ----------------------------------------------
     kclose()  ===> close a file descriptor ==> special handling of pipes.
     ===================================================================

3-4. Modifications to MTX system Kernel:

(1). Our MTX kernel already has sleep(event)/wakeup(event).
     In sleep()/wakeup(), show which task is being blocked/awakened.
     Initialize fd[ ] to 0 in all PROCs.

(2). In fork(): 
        Allow the child task to share ALL opened file descriptors with 
        the parent.

(3). In exit()
        The dying task must close its opened file descriptors (which
        may free the OFTs and/or pipes .... if it's the last task).


4. TESTING:
(1). In Umode, add the commands 
       ----------------------------------
        pipe   pfd   close  read   write  
       ----------------------------------
     which do the following:

(2). pipe: create a pipe, which sets up 2 file descriptors for the
           running task.
(3). pfd : display current open file descriptors, e.g.
              fd     type    mode
            -----   ------  -------
              0      PIPE    READ
              1      PIPE    WRITE
           -------------------------
(4). close: for task to close a fd

(5). read: prompt for a fd and nbytes. then try to read nbytes from the
           pipe to Umode. Display the bytes read in Umode.

(6). write: prompt for a fd and a text string, e.g. "abcdefghij", then
            try to write the text string to the pipe.

In addition, you should also implement a function
             showPipe(PIPE *p)
which displays the contents of the pipe, e.g.
      ------------------------------------------------------   
       #data = number of chars currently in the pipe;
       #room = number of rooms available in the pipe;
       contents = "........."; (actual chars in the pipe).
      ------------------------------------------------------
Inside the read_pipe()/write_pipe() function, it would be very informative 
if you call showPipe() to display the pipe conditions and contents.

7. Diagrams of Pipe Operations:

(1). Assume process P1 calls r = pipe(int pd[2]): kpipe() creates a PIPE struct
     allocates 2 OFTs and 2 fd[ ].

     to 2 and nreaders, nwriters to 2 also:

(3). P1 can only WRITE to pipe by pd[1];   P2 can only READ from pipie by pd[0]

                     P1                    P2
                WRITE pd[1] --> PIPE --> READ pd[0]


     OR          P1 -->WRITE--> PIPE --> READ --> P2

                                  |
  n = write(pd[1], wbuf, nbytes); |       n = read(pd[0], rbuf, nbytes);    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5). write()/read()  fd of PIPE are governed by 4(a) and 4(b).
