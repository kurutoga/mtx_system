                 Booting Operating Systems

Booting OS:

(1). PowerOn ===> CPU executes BIOS in ROM : 
      BIOS initializes itself, then it checks memory and other devices.
      Some information needed by BIOS are kept in a small cmos RAM, powered 
      by a battery.

(2). Then, BIOS looks for a system to boot. The usual booting sequence is A,C,
     which can be changed by programming the BIOS (cmos RAM). 

     First, BIOS tries to boot from drive A: If there is no diskette is A:,
     it will try to boot from C:

     Booting from a device is to load the FIRST sector of that device into
     (segment,offset)=(0000:7C00) and let CPU execute that piece of code.
 
     For a floppy diskette, there is only ONE boot sector. A hard disk is 
     usually divided into several Partitions, each with its own boot sector.
     The very first sector on a HD is called the Master Boot Record (MBR).

(3). Disk Parameters:
     All disks for PCs have Sector size = 512 bytes
     Every disk has CYL cylinders, H heads, and SECTOR sectors per track.

Examples: 
     1.44 MB diskette :   80 cylinders,   2 heads, 18 sectors/track 
     Hard disk        : 1010 cylinders,  12 heads, 35 sectors/track
                        2048 cylinders,  16 heads, 63 sectors/track, etc.

QUESTION#1: Given (CYL,H,SECTOR), determine the disk's capacity in MB.
     
     To issue I/O operations to a disk (controller), we must specify 
     (cyl, head, sector).  BIOS also uses such values in its disk I/O
     functions;  NOTE: cyl, head count from 0  but sector counts from 1.

(4). Partition Table:

     A hard disk can be divided into 4 Primary Partitions. The partitions
     are recorded in a Partition Table in the MBR at 0x1BE. Each Partition
     Table entry is a structure as shown below.

     struct partition {
        unsigned char boot_ind;         /* 0x80 - active */
        unsigned char head;             /* starting head */
        unsigned char sector;           /* starting sector */
        unsigned char cyl;              /* starting cylinder */
        unsigned char sys_ind;          /* What partition type */
        unsigned char end_head;         /* end head */
        unsigned char end_sector;       /* end sector */
        unsigned char end_cyl;          /* end cylinder */
        unsigned short start_sectlo;    /* starting sector counting from 0 */
        unsigned short start_secthi;    /* starting sector counting from 0 */
        unsigned short nr_sectslo;      /* nr of sectors in partition */
        unsigned short nr_sectshi;      /* nr of sectors in partition */
     };

     Each entry is 16 bytes (for a total of 64 bytes). The last 2 bytes of the
     boot sector contain the boot signature 0x55AA.
 
     The Partition Table is usually maintained by programs such as fdisk.
     Under Linux, you may use
           fdisk /dev/hda      or    fdisk /dev/hdb
     to display, modify the partition tables  of C: or D: drive.
       
     The first few bytes are maintained in a format that's convenient for 
     calling BIOS. Specifically,

              BYTE  1     2      3      4
                  -----  ----  ------ -----         
                  drive, head, sector, cyl
